Protect is distributed under the same license as perl itself.

  Protect allows you to set perl subroutines into one of three modes, public,
member, or private.

  In private mode, only code within the package in which the subroutine 
exists can call the subroutine.

  In member mode, only members with the package can call the subroutine.

  In public mode, any(one||thing) can call the subroutine.

  Protect, unfortunatly, does not work at compile time, only in run time.
Changing this would require some pretty hefty changes to the perl core, and
while they are supposed to be coming, I thought I'd write a quick solution
myself.  As usual my quick solution turned into something more useful.

  Any comments/questions appreciated.
